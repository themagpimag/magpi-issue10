I am new to RPi.  It is great.  Thanks for your mag.  I download it and then transfer to my Kindle where it is easy to read.

Thanks you for the great project regarding the pi magazine. When I was a child my father used to buy these kind of magazines and I miss them, not only for me, but for the new children who think the only OS in existence is that thing called windows, and when they look at linux just don't know what to do, even when they are computer related students. Don't ask when they are confronted with the command line.
